# Settings for Sublime Text

There are my settings for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). They're incomplete and undocumented, but will be improving over time as I tweak them.

This exists to help me git-ify all my hidden secret settings and confirguration, for organisation and backup. It's probably not useful for anyone else - except as reference.

Partially inspired by [Sublime-Text-2-User-Settings](https://github.com/d2s/Sublime-Text-2-User-Settings)

## Installation

You can check this out directly in to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
    git clone <repo path> User

I prefer to the git repo elsewhere then symlink the User directory to the git repo.
