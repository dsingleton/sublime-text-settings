# Settings for Sublime Text

There are my settings for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). They're incomplete and undocumented, but will be improving over time as I tweak them.

This exists to help me git-ify all my hidden secret settings and confirguration, for organisation and backup. It's probably not useful for anyone else - except as reference.

Partially inspired by [Sublime-Text-2-User-Settings](https://github.com/d2s/Sublime-Text-2-User-Settings)
